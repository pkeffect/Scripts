## README.md

Here are some very basic .bat scripts for easy downloading and installing of [SteamCMD](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/SteamCMD), [RUST](https://rust.facepunch.com/) and the different deployments [builds](https://github.com/CarbonCommunity/Carbon/releases) of the [Carbon](https://carbonmod.gg/) framework. Just follow the directions below to get started. These were written for quick and dirty deployment. Startup script examples will be added soon.


### STEPS
1. Download the .bat files for the release you want to use.
2. Create a local directory to place them in.
3. Run the steamcmd install script first (<i>c.install.steamCMD.bat</i>).
4. When its done type 'quit'.
5. Then run the .bat script for installing whichever release you chose (<i>c.install.<release_name></i>).
6. The install script also includes [Oxide.Ext.RustEdit.dll](https://github.com/k1lly0u/Oxide.Ext.RustEdit) and [Oxide.Ext.Discord.dll](https://umod.org/extensions/discord/) and places them in the correct directory for you, which is (/carbon/extensions/).
