## README.md

Here are some very basic .bat scripts for quick and easy downloading and installing of SteamCMD, RUST and the different deployments (builds) of the Carbon framework. Just follow the directions below to get started.
### STEPS
1. Download the .bat files for the release you want to use.
2. Create a local directory to place them in.
3. Run the steamcmd install script first.
4. When its done type 'quit'.
5. Then run the .bat script for installing whichever release you chose.
6. The install script also includes Oxide.Ext.RustEdit.dll and Oxide.Ext.Discord.dll and places them in the correct directory for you. Which is (carbon/extensions/).

<b>These are for Windows only!</b>
