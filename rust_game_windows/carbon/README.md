Download the .bat files for the release you want to use.

Create a local directory to place them in.

Run the steamcmd install script.

When its done type 'quit'.

Then run the .bat script for installing whichever release you chose.

The install script also includes Oxide.Ext.RustEdit.dll and Oxide.Ext.Discord.dll and places them in the correct directory for you.
